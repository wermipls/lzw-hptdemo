# lzw-hptdemo
**happy party three demo** is a ZX Spectrum 128K production, done by LZW group and first shown at the happy party three (an online visual art show). The source code is presented mostly for archival purposes - due to being my first attempt at coding something bigger in Z80 assembly, the code is mostly a mess and probably not good for anyone to use as a reference. 

# Building
## Windows
Run `make.bat`.
## Linux/macOS/others
Install sjasmplus, then run `sjasmplus prog.asm --sld --fullpath`.

# TODO
* verify real hardware compatibility
* add compression of main demo data for reduced size
